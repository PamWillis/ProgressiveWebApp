# Description
    - This project was created in order to have a better understanding of how Progressive Web Apps work. This PWA allows the user to have an app experience while still viewing on the web as well as the ability to download the app to use while off-line. The use of this app gives an understanding of how cache works and how it can improve the web app in speeding up how quickly you can view the app and still view your own inputs.
    - Highlights of learning include - Service Workers, Web App Manifest, Responsive Design and Cache API.
    - PWA allows apps to load quickly, serving cached content while the device is not connected to the internet.
    - PWAs combine the best features of web and mobile apps, providing reliable and fast usage that works amoungst different devices. They offer off-line functionality, with an app-like feeling while interacting.
